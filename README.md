#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

ans : Template literals are a new way to write strings in JavaScript. They make it much easier to work with strings, especially when you want to include variables or create multi-line text. use `` backticks to creat template literals. and you can add variables or expressions use ${}.Can write strings in multiple lines without using \n.

string concatenation:

let name = "Nirob";
let age = 19;
let message = "Hello " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old.";
console.log(message);



template literal:

let name = "Nirob";
let age = 19;
let message = `Hello ${name}, you are ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message);
